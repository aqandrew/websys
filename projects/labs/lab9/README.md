It would have been great to know from the beginning that table names and database names can't be specified via variables in prepared PDO statements. It also would've been nice to know that PDO::exec() returns 1 upon successful creation of a database and 0 upon successful creation of a table.

I calculated each student's GPA as the average of all grades they have received, independent of the course in which each grade was received.

Information about subqueries would have been useful in lectures.
