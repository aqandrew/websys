Name: Andrew Aquino

I used the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration because I wrote the markup for HTML5, because it's robust and modern. It differs from other doctypes because it doesn't require a DTD to be downloaded.

Most of the semantic correctness of my document comes from its use of unordered lists--for example, including <span>s with date classes inside list elements specifying a position held at some institution.

The only semantic element I used for styling purposes was the <div> enclosing my objective statement, to make it play nice with my photo and contact information at the top of the page.
	
The hCard information is useful to both humans and automated agents searching for my information because while it is semantically correct, it is also easily traversable by a parser.
